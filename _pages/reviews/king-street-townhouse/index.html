    <p class="text--lg">Hi! We are Alice (brunette) and Hannah (blonde), the creatives behind Belle & Bunty – the award-winning womens designer label and style blog!</p>
    <p class="text--lg">We’re big fans of the staycation. With minimal fuss we can strut through incredible cities in the UK, armed with a wardrobe to complement all the exciting things we can do. You’ll catch us scoring gems in indie boutiques, checking out cool galleries, or kicking-back in buzzing bars as the evening sets in.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">Manchester is one of our favourite UK cities. It is a really cool place packed with great bars, galleries and awesome shopping – and some of the friendliest people you will ever meet! On the 2nd Sunday of each month the super cool Makers Market comes to the Northern Quarter and we recommend anyone in town to stroll through it! Handmade jewellery, vintage stands and the most delicious food stalls all come together for a unique shopping experience in the hustle and bustle of city life. It travels around the country, but always features local talent – there was a mixture of Manchester based artists, designers, creative producers & bakers. Plus they have a resident DJ playing all day long which puts a little hop in your step as you go around! </p>

      <p class="text--lg">The King Street Townhouse is a stunning hotel in the middle of Manchester, easy walking distance to everything you may need. The bedrooms have the ‘wow’ factor with interiors that look like they’re straight out of Elle Decor – plus extra quirky touches that we just loved. A roll top bath in the bedroom was a highlight for us with floor to ceiling windows for epic views of the city. The restaurant has a grand, colonial feel whilst also mixing a laid-back, ‘bougie’ vibe that allows for hours of relaxing, eating gorgeous food and sipping cocktails or coffee (in the cutest moustache cups!).</p>

      <p class="text--lg">When you are going on a short break you don’t want to over pack so we always organise our outfits by occasion to make sure all bases are covered, day to night. A great maxi dress (or 2 pieces midi co-ord!) will be your best friend on a city break, worn with espadrilles or flat sandals – perfect for explore the city in the daytime or swapping to heels for a glamorous dinner look. You can’t go wrong with jeans and a decorative top to look stylish whilst also being comfortable, with a short suit being one of our favourite looks for a city break. You can mix and match the shorts with a simple tee or add a blazer to take your look up a notch for the evening. We usually pack a variety of shoes to cover all bases, from a super comfortable espadrille wedge that’s great for summer, to a tan suede heel that looks smart but not too dressy. An essential pair of heels will make all outfits perfect for the evening.</p>
