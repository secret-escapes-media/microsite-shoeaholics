    subtitle: Didsbury House, Manchester

      <p class="text--lg">The King Street Townhouse is a stunning hotel in the middle of Manchester, easy walking distance to everything you may need. The bedrooms themselves have the ‘wow’ factor with interiors that look like that are out of Elle Deco plus extra quirky touches that we loved. A roll top bath in the bedroom was a highlight for us with floor to ceiling windows for epic views of the city. The restaurant has a grand, colonial feel while also mixing a laid back boujie vibe that allows for hours of relaxing eating gorgeous food and sipping cocktails or coffee (in the cutest moustache cups!) alike.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">We ate brunch at Evelyns Cafe in the Northern Quarter which serves a mean beetroot and cashew burger amongst super cool modern decor of exposed brick walls and heaps of hanging plants.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">When you are going on a short break you don’t want to over pack so we always organise our outfits by occasion to make sure all bases are covered, day to night. A great maxi dress (or 2 pieces midi co-ord!) will be your best friend on a city break worn with espadrilles or flat sandals to explore the city in the daytime or with heels for a glamorous dinner look. You can't go wrong with jeans and a decorative top to look stylish while also comfortable and a short suit is one of our favourite looks for a city break as you can mix and match both the shorts with a simple tee or add a blazer to take your look up a notch for the evening with a heel. We’d pack a variety of shoes to also cover all bases from a super comfortable espadrille wedge that we love every Summer, to a tan suede heel that looks smart but not too dressy and a pair of heels that will make all outfits perfect for the evening.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">We like to pack within a colour palette as this makes putting outfits together so much easier! So for example go for a neutral selection of garments with one or 2 highlight shades which will mix and match together to give you a variety of day and evening looks. If, like us, you like a burst of colour then you can add a bright pop with a vibrant dress, top or statement shoe to give your look a fun, Summery feel. On the practical side we always roll clothes and don’t fold to avoid creases as much as possible and if all else fails one hotel hack we swear by is hanging creased clothing in a hot steamy bathroom to help any stubborn creases drop out. </p>
