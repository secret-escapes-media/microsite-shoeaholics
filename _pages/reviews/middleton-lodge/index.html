  intro: >
    <p class="text--lg">As a self-confessed shopaholic, blogging has become a way to make a habit into a full-time job.</p>
    <p class="text--lg">Being Turkish Cypriot brings out the need for travel and sunshine, which is always scattered across my content. I’m never too far away from a sunset beach outfit – so if you ask what are my two passions? Shoes & travel ( + food if I can have a third).</p>

      <p class="text--lg">The Yorkshire dales are quintessential British countryside. Clean air, rolling hills and a cosy pub in every valley. Richmond town feels like a real local’s place. A romantic haven, me and my boyfriend strolled the town hand in hand stopping for cream tea in Cross View Restaurant and admired the view of the castle from all over town.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">A retreat away from city life! We woke from a deep sleep, with thanks to the gorgeous bedding and huge bed, rolled straight into the roll-top bathtub in our open-plan room, and marvelled at the authentic wooden beams and dark oak floors. The restaurant served the best English, home-cooked food. Asparagus starters were followed by steak and chips – a hearty must following a full body massage at the in-house spa.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">After dinner head for the gardens at sunset. It’s the perfect backdrop for your photos – plus, jumping on the vintage-style bikes makes the perfect Instagram update! We cycled around the grounds of Middleton Lodge on one sunny day – it took 40 minutes, that’s how vast the space is! </p>

      <p class="text--lg">Packing for a country break is great because there’s no luggage limit when you’re driving with a car! I’ll usually take a few options of shoes as they can make an outfit and you can dress up jeans with sliders in the day, or statement metallic block heels in the evening. Colours are also key! I pack dark colours for more country activities such as bike riding, croquet, long walks (mud safe colours!) and then light colours like my favourite white skinny jeans to wear with my pastel Nine West wedge.</p>
